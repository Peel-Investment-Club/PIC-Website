# Peel Investment Club
## About
The Peel Investment Club is an organization for students, by students, dedicated to spreading financial literacy among youth. I founded the Peel Investment Club as I felt that the education system has a significant gap within the curriculum, as students are not taught basic financial concepts essential for their success, such as saving for retirement or value investing. 

## Features & Design
The website was made using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, I first designed the basic design of the site in Figma, and then created the code around it. The website has a minimalist design, it gets straight to the point, making content easy to read while still looking sleek.
